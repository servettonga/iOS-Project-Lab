The Snow Globe Repairman

Crawford looks at his hands with their knuckles like tectonic
plates, cradling a seeping globe that encloses

the Pyramids of Giza. Like his wife’s breast
and the frayed head of the old retriever. So much

the same, how they fit within his palm. In a glass
cupola, vees of geese tilt north past New York City,

the Peace Arch and hula girls sway in a slurried snow.
They all come to him here; every dreamt destination,

every journey’s souvenir lies unwrapped, nested in
a newspaper from Poughkeepsie or brown parchment.

What a woman wants to preserve of the grotto at the Bay
of Conca Dei Marini rests in a tangle of pliers and glue,

tubes of glitter in gold, silver, and the occasional blue.
He knows something of purity’s formula, can mix up water

sweet enough not to cloud or green. He examines a curve
for imperfection, a flaw like a mar on a peach that needs

the tender knife. And although this particular day he enters
the workshop more slowly, and cups heat first in a fist

to limber up stiff joints, he recalls well enough
similar evenings when the light was going, when she waited

for him to finish. How her voice traveled across the field
as she called him home for dinner. They spoke of Paris

at the orchard gate. He stretches tendons for the delicate
work of repair, heaven’s dome fixed securely above.

The Dignity of Ushers

Their authority did not unfold
from ironed white shirts and thin ties
or from the funereal seriousness that struck
their acne-splashed faces but because
they stood heir to our native faith in light.

So we followed the thin white waver
of beams they pointed down aisles
to seats we never thought of refusing.
It was the first job I wanted,
especially after birthday outings

far from home showed me the glowing
outfits worn by big-city ushers, their get-ups
a blend of doorman and military dictator,
as gaudy and fine as the plots
of movies my Saturdays were swallowed by.

None of us knew, as they took us
into the artificial light of the cinema,
that they walked the path of the pin setter,
the blacksmith or elevator operator,
professions reduced to curiosity

by wandering time. Only in the quick steps
of floor salesmen, the slim backs of hostesses
bringing us to our tables, do they remain,
the artful flutters of their flashlights lost
in dark we are left to find our own way through.
